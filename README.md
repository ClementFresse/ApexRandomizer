# ApexRandomizer
The Apex Legends streamer WillDT11 has brought the idea that it could be interesting to have an Apex loadout randomizer to choose a completely random loadout to try to climb up with in ranked games.

The final product should be in the form of a python (tkinter) interface as an executable file with no apparent program to make it user friendly. The loadout should contain a legend, a primary weapon and optionally a secondary weapon. It could also be interesting to be able to ban some equipment or some specific combinations from the lists. We also need to establish if the chosen primary weapon should be the one equipped in Ballistic's sling in case this legend is chosen.

Keep in mind that the code is (for now) entirely written by me and that I am not a professional programmer.
